# Welcome to Lasgiti!
It's pretty simple: this is an Android app that shows you GitHub users that have
 Java repositories AND are resident in Lagos, Nigeria. It ranks these users based
 on how many repositories they have. This is a strong indicator of how much experience they
 have in creating software with Java and how involved they are with the developer
 community in Lagos.
 

## "Where can I get the app?"
Easy! You can download a built version of Lasgiti (i.e an APK) at [this link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/z0zeocns45s5s0v/lasgiti.apk?dl=0). Install it on your Android device and enjoy!

## How to build the app
The following steps are needed to build this app.
* You need a recent version of Android Studio. If you don't have this, head over to
[this link](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) to install
it and its dependencies.
* If you have Git installed on your computer, open a terminal/command prompt and
clone this repo with this command:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Maviza101/lasgiti.git
```
If you can't do the above, go to [this link](https://github.com/Maviza101/lasgiti),
download this repo as a ZIP file and extract it.
* Start Android Studio. Using the toolbar at the top of the window, go to "File > Open..."
and navigate to where you saved the repository from the step above. Choose that
 directory/folder (it should be named "lasgiti").
* That's it! You can either run the app in an emulator on your computer (using Shift + F10)
or you can build an APK and install it on your Android device.
